# Data Science and Machine Learning Lab

This repository contains personal exercises and solutions developed for the course *01VSCWS – Data Science and Machine Learning Lab* at Politecnico di Torino.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course focuses on the design and implementation of data-driven processes used to extract knowledge from data and support decision making.  
It first introduces the complete data science workflow, covering its main phases from problem framing to data preparation, exploration, modeling, and evaluation.  
The course then provides theoretical and practical knowledge of core data mining and basic machine learning algorithms for analyzing large and heterogeneous datasets, using state-of-the-art Python libraries and a learning-by-doing approach in the lab.
